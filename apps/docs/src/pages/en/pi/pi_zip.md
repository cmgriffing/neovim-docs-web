## <a id="zip-usage zip-manual" class="section-title" href="#zip-usage zip-manual">2. Usage</a> 

### <a id="When one edits a .zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a" class="section-title" href="#When one edits a .zip file, this plugin will handle displaying a">Note:</a>
   contents page.  Select a file to edit by moving the cursor atop
   the desired file, then hit the <return> key.  After editing, one may
   also write to the file.  Currently, one may not make a new file in
   zip archives via the plugin.

   COMMANDS~
### <a id="zip-x" class="section-title" href="#zip-x">Note:</a>
   x : extract a listed file when the cursor is atop it

   OPTIONS~

### <a id="g:zip_nomax" class="section-title" href="#g:zip_nomax">Note:</a>

   If this variable exists and is true, the file window will not be
   automatically maximized when opened.

### <a id="g:zip_shq" class="section-title" href="#g:zip_shq">Note:</a>
   Different operating systems may use one or more shells to execute
   commands.  Zip will try to guess the correct quoting mechanism to
   allow spaces and whatnot in filenames; however, if it is incorrectly
   guessing the quote to use for your setup, you may use
```	g:zip_shq
  which by default is a single quote under Unix (') and a double quote
   under Windows (").  If you'd rather have no quotes, simply set
   g:zip_shq to the empty string (let g:zip_shq= "") in your <.vimrc>.

### <a id="g:zip_unzipcmd" class="section-title" href="#g:zip_unzipcmd">Note:</a>
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "unzip".
   It's used during browsing. By default:
   	let g:zip_unzipcmd= "unzip"
```

### <a id="g:zip_zipcmd" class="section-title" href="#g:zip_zipcmd">Note:</a>
   Use this option to specify the program which does the duty of "zip".
   It's used during the writing (updating) of a file already in a zip
   file; by default:
```   	let g:zip_zipcmd= "zip"
```

### <a id="g:zip_extractcmd" class="section-title" href="#g:zip_extractcmd">Note:</a>
   This option specifies the program (and any options needed) used to
   extract a file from a zip archive.  By default,
```   	let g:zip_extractcmd= g:zip_unzipcmd
```

   PREVENTING LOADING~

   If for some reason you do not wish to use vim to examine zipped files,
   you may put the following two variables into your <.vimrc> to prevent
   the zip plugin from loading:
```
	let g:loaded_zipPlugin= 1
	let g:loaded_zip      = 1
```


## <a id="zip-extension" class="section-title" href="#zip-extension">3. Additional Extensions</a> 

Apparently there are a number of archivers which generate zip files that
   don't use the .zip extension (.jar, .xpi, etc).  To handle such files,
   place a line in your <.vimrc> file:
```
	au BufReadCmd *.jar,*.xpi call zip#Browse(expand("<amatch>"))
```

   One can simply extend this line to accommodate additional extensions that
   should be treated as zip files.

### <a id="Alternatively, one may change g:zipPlugin_ext in one's .vimrc." class="section-title" href="#Alternatively, one may change g:zipPlugin_ext in one's .vimrc.">Note:</a>
   Currently (11/30/15) it holds:

	let g:zipPlugin_ext= '*.zip,*.jar,*.xpi,*.ja,*.war,*.ear,*.celzip,
